# Sentiment-Analysis
As a Data Scientist, I worked on a project and developed a comprehensive Movie Sentiment Analysis that evaluates user reviews for sentiment classification. This project employs various techniques and models, structured as follows:
I implemented two primary methodologies for sentiment analysis:
1.	Custom Model:
o	Utilized Bag of Words (BOW) and TF-IDF vectorization techniques to transform text data into numerical features.
o	Built and evaluated Naive Bayes classifiers using both feature sets, optimizing model performance through cross-validation.
2.	Pretrained Model:
o	Leveraged the VADER sentiment analyzer, a rule-based model specifically designed for sentiment analysis of social media texts.
o	Compared results from the VADER model with those of my custom models for comprehensive evaluation.
The results of this project provide valuable insights into audience sentiment, contributing to enhanced decision-making in film marketing and content development.
